# Python - Everything is object

In this project, I explored Python's object-oriented programming features, focusing on concepts like object instantiation, variable aliasing, and object identifiers. Through quiz-like questions, I deepened my understanding of classes, objects, mutable and immutable types, and variable referencing. I demonstrated my knowledge by providing concise answers in single-line .txt files.
