# Python - Almost a circle

This project is a part of the Higher level curriculum focusing on Python programming. It encompasses various aspects of Python development including imports, exceptions, classes, private attributes, getters/setters, class methods, static methods, inheritance, unit testing, and file handling. Additionally, I delve into advanced topics such as *args and **kwargs, serialization/deserialization, and JSON handling. The project aims to solidify my understanding of these concepts through practical implementation and testing.

# Background Context

*The project prepared me to tackling larger Python projects, particularly emphasizing on:

  + Implementing unit tests effectively in large-scale projects.

  + Serializing and deserializing Python objects.

  + Handling JSON files for data storage and retrieval.

  + Mastering the usage of *args and `**kwargs for flexible function definitions.`

  + Managing named arguments in Python functions.

# Resources

*To enhance my understanding and implementation, I referred to the following resources:

  +  Documentation and tutorials on *args and **kwargs
  +  Guides on JSON encoder and decoder in Python
  +  Documentation for the unittest module
  +  Python test cheatsheets for effective unit testing strategies

# Learning Objectives

+By the end of this project, I was able to explain and apply the following concepts without external assistance:

  +  The concept and importance of unit testing in software development.
  +  Techniques for serializing and deserializing Python classes
  +  Methods for reading from and writing to JSON files using Python
  +  Practical applications of *args and `**kwargs in Python functions
  +  Strategies for managing named arguments effectively in Python functions
