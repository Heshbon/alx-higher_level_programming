# 0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions.


In this project I started using conditionals and Python loops, while and for loops with if, if... else, break, continue, pass, and range expressions. I learned about arithmetic operators, tracebacks, and the scope of variables while building my own Python functions.

# Tasks 📃.

  + Prints the number followed by:

	- If the number is greater than 0: is positive.

	- If the number is 0: is zero.

	- If the number is less than 0: is negative.

  + Followed by a new line.
