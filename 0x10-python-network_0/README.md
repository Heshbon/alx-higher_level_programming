# Python - Network #0

In this networking project, I utilized curl in Bash scripts to interact with web servers and handle various HTTP requests and responses. Through this project, I gained knowledge about domain names,  the structure of URLs, and the different HTTP request and response header fields. Additionally, I read about HTTP Cookie and what it is.

# Tasks ðŸ“ƒ

# 0. cURL body size

  + <u>[0-body_size.sh](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x10-python-network_0/0-body_size.sh)</u>: Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a request to that URL, and displays the size of the body of the response.

# 1. cURL to the end

  + <u>[1-body.sh](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x10-python-network_0/1-body.sh)</u>: Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response.

# 2. cURL Method

  + <u>[2-delete.sh](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x10-python-network_0/2-delete.sh)</u>: Bash script that sends a DELETE request to the URL passed as the first argument and displays the body of the response.

# 3. cURL only methods

  + <u>[3-methods.sh](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x10-python-network_0/3-methods.sh)</u>: Bash script that takes in a URL and displays all HTTP methods the server will accept.

# 4. cURL headers

  + <u>[4-header.sh](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x10-python-network_0/4-header.sh)</u>: Bash script that takes in a URL as an argument, sends a GET request to the URL, and displays the body of the response.

# 5. cURL POST parameters

  + <u>[5-post_params.sh](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x10-python-network_0/5-post_params.sh)</u>: Bash script that takes in a URL, sends a POST request to the passed URL, and displays the body of the response.

# 6. Find a peak

  + <u>[6-peak.py](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x10-python-network_0/6-peak.py)</u>: Python function that finds a peak in a list of unsorted integers.

  + <u>[6-peak.txt](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x10-python-network_0/6-peak.txt)</u>: Text file that contains the complexity of my algorithm.

# 7. Only status code

  + <u>[100-status_code.sh](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x10-python-network_0/100-status_code.sh)</u>: Bash script that sends a request to a URL passed as an argument, and displays only the status code of the response.

# 8. cURL a JSON file

  + <u>[101-post_json.sh](https://github.com/Heshbon/alx-higher_level_programming/blob/master/0x10-python-network_0/101-post_json.sh)</u>: Bash script that sends a JSON POST request to a URL passed as the first argument, and displays the body of the response.
