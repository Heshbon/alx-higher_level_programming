# JavaScript - Web scraping

In this project, I took time to  understand  JavaScript and JSON data manipulation. I learned from resources like "Working with JSON data," Jimmy Tran's JSON guide, and the request module documentation. Key goals include understanding JavaScript's power, handling JSON data, using HTTP request methods (request, fetch, axios), and reading/writing files with Node.js fs module.
